# Security Policy

Security and bug fixes are generally provided only for the last minor version. Fixes are released either as part of the next minor version or as an on-demand patch version.

Security fixes are given priority and might be enough to cause a new version to be released.


## Supported Versions


| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.2     | ✅                |
| 0.1     | ✅                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In order for the vulnerability reports to reach maintainers as soon as possible, the preferred way is to use the ["Report a vulnerability"](https://github.com/mathLab/PINA/security/advisories/new) button under the "Security" tab of the associated GitHub project. This creates a private communication channel between the reporter and the maintainers.
