Contributing to PINA
=====================

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute to **PINA**! Your help makes the project better for everyone. This document outlines the process for contributing, reporting issues, suggesting features, and submitting pull requests.

How to Contribute
-----------------

You can contribute in several ways:

- Reporting bugs
- Suggesting features or enhancements
- Submitting fixes or improvements via Pull Requests (PRs)
- Improving documentation

We encourage all contributions, big or small!

Reporting Bugs
--------------

If you find a bug, please open an `issue <https://github.com/mathLab/PINA/issues>`_ and include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or error messages
- Environment info (OS, Python version, dependencies, etc.)

Suggesting Enhancements
-----------------------

We welcome new ideas! If you have an idea to improve PINA:

1. Check the `issue tracker <https://github.com/mathLab/PINA/issues>`_ or the `discussions <https://github.com/mathLab/PINA/discussions>`_ to see if someone has already suggested it.
2. If not, open a new issue describing:
   - The enhancement you would like
   - Why it would be useful
   - Any ideas on how to implement it (optional but helpful)
3. If you are not sure about the enhancement, open a discussion to collaborate with the PINA community.

Pull Request Process
--------------------

Before submitting a PR:

1. Ensure there is an open issue related to your contribution (or create one).
2. `Fork <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>`_ the repository and create a new branch from ``master``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git checkout -b feature/my-feature

3. Make your changes:
   - Write clear, concise, and well-documented code
   - Add or update tests where appropriate
   - Update documentation if necessary
4. Verify your changes by running tests:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pytest

5. Format your code:

   .. code-block:: bash

      bash code_formatter.sh

6. Submit a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request>`_ with a clear explanation of your changes and reference the related issue if applicable.

Pull Request Checklist:
