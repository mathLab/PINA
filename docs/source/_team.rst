A significant part of **PINA** has been written either as a by-product for other projects people were funded for, or by people on university-funded positions.
There are probably many of such projects that have led to some development of **PINA**. We are very grateful for this support!
In particular, we acknowledge the following sources of support with great gratitude:

* `H2020 ERC CoG 2015 AROMA-CFD project 681447 <https://people.sissa.it/~grozza/aroma-cfd/>`_, P.I. Professor `Prof. Gianluigi Rozza <https://mathlab.sissa.it/people/gianluigi-rozza>`_ at `SISSA MathLab <https://mathlab.sissa.it/>`_.
* `Next Generation EU <https://www.agenziacoesione.gov.it/dossier_tematici/nextgenerationeu-e-pnrr/>`_ for ambiental and digital transition for Italy.
