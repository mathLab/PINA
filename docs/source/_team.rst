PINA Team
==============

PINA is currently developed by `Dario Coscia <https://github.com/dario-coscia>`_, `Nicola Demo <https://github.com/ndem0>`_, and `Anna Ivagnes <https://github.com/annaivagnes>`_
under the supervision of `Prof. Gianluigi Rozza <https://mathlab.sissa.it/people/gianluigi-rozza>`_ in the `SISSA MathLab <https://mathlab.sissa.it/>`_ group.

A significant part of PINA has been written either as a by-product for other projects people were funded for, or by people on university-funded positions.
There are probably many of such projects that have led to some development of PINA. We are very grateful for this support!
In particular, we acknowledge the following sources of support with great gratitude:

* `H2020 ERC CoG 2015 AROMA-CFD project 681447 <https://people.sissa.it/~grozza/aroma-cfd/>`_, P.I. Professor `Prof. Gianluigi Rozza <https://mathlab.sissa.it/people/gianluigi-rozza>`_ at `SISSA MathLab <https://mathlab.sissa.it/>`_.
* `Next Generation EU <https://www.agenziacoesione.gov.it/dossier_tematici/nextgenerationeu-e-pnrr/>`_ for ambiental and digital transitionfor, Italy.
