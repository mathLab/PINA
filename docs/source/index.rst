Welcome to PINA's documentation!
===================================================

PINA is a Python package providing an easy interface to deal with
physics-informed neural networks (PINN) for the approximation of (differential,
nonlinear, ...) functions. Based on Pytorch, PINA offers a simple and intuitive
way to formalize a specific problem and solve it using PINN.

Physics-informed neural network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PINN is a novel approach that involves neural networks to solve supervised
learning tasks while respecting any given law of physics described by general
nonlinear differential equations. Proposed in "Physics-informed neural
networks: A deep learning framework for solving forward and inverse problems
involving nonlinear partial differential equations", such framework aims to
solve problems in a continuous and nonlinear settings.
