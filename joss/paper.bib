abstract = {We introduce physics-informed neural networks – neural networks that are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while respecting any given laws of physics described by general nonlinear partial differential equations. In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.}

abstract = {In this work we investigate the possibility of using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate the Euler equations that model high-speed aerodynamic flows. In particular, we solve both the forward and inverse problems in one-dimensional and two-dimensional domains. For the forward problem, we utilize the Euler equations and the initial/boundary conditions to formulate the loss function, and solve the one-dimensional Euler equations with smooth solutions and with solutions that have a contact discontinuity as well as a two-dimensional oblique shock wave problem. We demonstrate that we can capture the solutions with only a few scattered points clustered randomly around the discontinuities. For the inverse problem, motivated by mimicking the Schlieren photography experimental technique used traditionally in high-speed aerodynamics, we use the data on density gradient ∇ρ(x,t), the pressure p(x∗,t) at a specified point x=x∗ as well as the conservation laws to infer all states of interest (density, velocity and pressure fields). We present illustrative benchmark examples for both the problem with smooth solutions and Riemann problems (Sod and Lax problems) with PINNs, demonstrating that all inferred states are in good agreement with the reference solutions. Moreover, we show that the choice of the position of the point x∗ plays an important role in the learning process. In particular, for the problem with smooth solutions we can randomly choose the position of the point x∗ from the computational domain, while for the Sod or Lax problem, we have to choose the position of the point x∗ from the domain between the initial discontinuous point and the shock position of the final time. We also solve the inverse problem by combining the aforementioned data and the Euler equations in characteristic form, showing that the results obtained by using the Euler equations in characteristic form are better than that obtained by using the Euler equations in conservative form. Furthermore, we consider another type of inverse problem, specifically, we employ PINNs to learn the value of the parameter γ in the equation of state for the parameterized two-dimensional oblique wave problem by using the given data of the density, velocity and the pressure, and we identify the parameter γ accurately. Taken together, our results demonstrate that in the current form, where the conservation laws are imposed at random points, PINNs are not as accurate as traditional numerical methods for forward problems but they are superior for inverse problems that cannot even be solved with standard techniques.}

abstract = {Fatigue life of a wind turbine main bearing is drastically affected by the state of the grease used as lubricant. Unfortunately monitoring the grease condition through predictive models can be a daunting task due to uncertainties associated with degradation mechanism and variations in grease batch quality. Eventually, discrepancies in the grease life predictions caused by variable grease quality may lead up to inaccurate bearing fatigue life predictions. The convoluted nature of the problem requires a novel solution approach; and in this contribution, we propose a new hybrid physics-informed neural network model. We construct a hybrid model for bearing fatigue damage accumulation embedded as a recurrent neural network cell, where reduced-order physics models used for bearing fatigue damage accumulation, and neural networks represent grease degradation mechanism that quantifies grease damage that ultimately accelerates bearing fatigue. We outline a two-step probabilistic approach to quantify the grease quality variation. In the first step, we make use of the hybrid model to learn the grease degradation when the quality is the median of the distribution. In the second step, we take the median predictor from the first step and track the quantiles of the quality distribution by examining grease samples of each wind turbine. We finally showcase our approach with a numerical experiment, where we test the effect of the random realizations of quality variation and the number of sampled turbines on the performance of the model. Results of the numerical experiment indicate that given enough samples from different wind turbines, our method can successfully learn the median grease degradation and uncertainty about it. With this predictive model, we are able to optimize the regreasing intervals on a turbine-by-turbine basis. The source codes and links to the data can be found in the following GitHub repository https://github.com/PML-UCF/pinn_wind_bearing.}
