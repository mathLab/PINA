class R3Refinement(BaseRefinement):
    """
    Refinement strategy based on the R3 (Retain-Resample-Release) algorithm.

    This method adaptively updates collocation points by retaining points with
    high residuals, resampling new points in the domain, releasing points with
    low residuals.

    The objective is to concentrate sampling in regions where the PDE residual
    is large, improving training efficiency and solution accuracy.
