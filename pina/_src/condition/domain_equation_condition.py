    The class :class:`DomainEquationCondition` defines a condition based on a

    physics-informed problems, where the model is trained to satisfy a given
    ``equation`` over a specified ``domain``. The ``domain`` is used to sample
    points where the ``equation`` residual is evaluated and minimized during
    training.
