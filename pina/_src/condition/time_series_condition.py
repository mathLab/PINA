class TimeSeriesCondition(BaseCondition):
    """
    The :class:`TimeSeriesCondition` class represents an autoregressive time
    series condition defined by temporal ``input`` data. The input is expected
    to have shape ``[trajectories, time_steps, *features]``, where the second
    dimension corresponds to the temporal evolution of each trajectory.

    During training, the condition automatically extracts overlapping temporal
    windows from the trajectories. The parameter ``unroll_length`` defines the
    number of consecutive time steps contained in each temporal window, while
    ``n_windows`` controls how many temporal windows are created from the
    available trajectories.

    Internally, the unrolled data is stored as a tensor of shape
    ``[trajectories, n_windows, unroll_length, *features]``.

    Supported data types include :class:`~pina.label_tensor.LabelTensor` and
    :class:`torch.Tensor`.

    :Example:

    >>> from pina import Condition, LabelTensor
    >>> import torch

    >>> data = LabelTensor(torch.rand(5, 10, 2), labels=["u", "v"])
    >>> condition = Condition(input=data, unroll_length=5, n_windows=3)
