    """
    Base class for all equations, implementing common functionality.

    Equations are fundamental components in PINA, representing mathematical
    constraints that must be satisfied by the model outputs. They can be passed
    to :class:`~pina.condition.condition.Condition` objects to define the
    conditions under which the model is trained.

    All specific equation types should inherit from this class and implement its
    abstract methods.

    This class is not meant to be instantiated directly.

    :Example:

        >>> # This class is not meant to be instantiated directly.
        >>> # Use specific equation implementations instead:
        >>> from pina.equation import PoissonEquation
        >>> eq = PoissonEquation(forcing_term=lambda x: x**2)
