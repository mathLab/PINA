class VectorizedSpline(torch.nn.Module):
    r"""
    The vectorized B-spline model class.

    A :class:`VectorizedSpline` represents a vector spline, i.e., a collection
    of independent univariate B-splines evaluated in parallel. Each univariate
    spline has its own knot vector and its own control points, and acts on one
    input feature.

    Given ``s`` univariate splines, the vector spline maps an input
    :math:`x = (x^{(1)}, \dots, x^{(s)}) \in \mathbb{R}^s` to an output obtained
    by evaluating each univariate spline on its corresponding scalar input
    :math:`x^{(j)}`.

    For the :math:`j`-th univariate spline of order :math:`k`, the output is
    defined as

    .. math::

        S^{(j)}(x^{(j)}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} B_{i,k}^{(j)}(x^{(j)}) C_i^{(j)},

    where:

    - :math:`C^{(j)}` are the control points of the :math:`j`-th univariate
      spline. In the scalar-output case, :math:`C^{(j)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_j}`.
      More generally, each univariate spline may have output dimension
      :math:`o`, so :math:`C^{(j)} \in \mathbb{R}^{o \times n_j}`.
    - :math:`B_{i,k}^{(j)}(x)` are the B-spline basis functions of order
      :math:`k`, i.e., piecewise polynomials of degree :math:`k-1`, associated
      with the knot vector of the :math:`j`-th univariate spline.
    - :math:`X^{(j)} = \{x_1^{(j)}, x_2^{(j)}, \dots, x_{m_j}^{(j)}\}` is the
      non-decreasing knot vector of the :math:`j`-th univariate spline.

    If the first and last knots of a given univariate spline are repeated
    :math:`k` times, then that univariate spline interpolates its first and last
    control points.

    The full vector spline evaluates all univariate splines in parallel. If each
    univariate spline has output dimension :math:`o`, then before optional
    aggregation the output has shape ``[batch, s, o]``.

    .. note::

        Each univariate spline is forced to be zero outside the interval defined
        by the first and last knots of its own knot vector.

    .. note::

        This class does not represent a single multivariate spline
        :math:`\mathbb{R}^s \to \mathbb{R}^o` with a genuinely multivariate
        basis. Instead, it represents a vector of splines built from ``s``
        independent univariate splines, one for each input feature.

    .. note::

        When using the :meth:`derivative` method of this class, derivatives are
        computed directly in vectorized form and returned with the correct
        shape. In contrast, when relying on ``autograd``, derivatives must be
        computed separately for each output dimension of each univariate spline
        and then combined, since autograd does not natively handle this
        vectorized structure.

            basis functions are polynomials of degree ``order - 1``.
            Default is 4.
        :param knots: The knots of the spline. If a tensor is provided, it must
            have shape ``[s, n]``, where ``s`` is the number of univariate
            splines and ``n`` is the number of knots per univariate spline. If a
            dictionary is provided, it must contain the keys ``"n"``, ``"min"``,
            ``"max"``, ``"mode"``, and ``"n_splines"``. Here, ``"n"`` specifies
            the number of knots for each univariate spline, ``"min"`` and
            ``"max"`` define the interval, ``"mode"`` selects the sampling
            strategy, and ``"n_splines"`` specifies the number of univariate
            splines. The supported modes are ``"uniform"``, where the knots are
            evenly spaced over :math:`[min, max]`, and ``"auto"``, where knots
            are constructed to ensure that each univariate spline interpolates
            the first and last control points. In this case, the number of knots
            is adjusted if :math:`n < 2 * order`. If None is given, knots are
            initialized automatically over :math:`[0, 1]` ensuring interpolation
            of the first and last control points. Default is None.

            each univariate spline has ``c`` control points and output dimension
            ``o``. In the latter case, the control points are expanded to shape
            ``[s, 1, c]``. If None, control points are initialized to learnable
            parameters with zero initial value. Default is None.
        :param str aggregate_output: If None, the output of each univariate
            spline is returned separately, resulting in an output of shape
            ``[batch, s, o]``, where ``s`` is the number of univariate splines
            and ``o`` is the output dimension of each univariate spline. If set
