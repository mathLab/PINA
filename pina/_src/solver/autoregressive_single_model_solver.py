class AutoregressiveSingleModelSolver(_AutoregressiveMixin, SingleModelSolver):
    r"""
    Single-model solver for autoregressive learning problems.

    This solver learns the time evolution of dynamical systems using a single
    model. It is intended for problems defined by time-series data and accepts
    only
    :class:`~pina._src.condition.time_series_condition.TimeSeriesCondition`.

    Given a sequence of states :math:`\{\mathbf{u}_t\}_{t=0}^{T}`, the solver
    trains a model :math:`\mathcal{M}` to predict the next state from the
    current one:

    .. math::

        \hat{\mathbf{u}}_{t+1} = \mathcal{M}(\mathbf{u}_t).

    The autoregressive training objective minimizes the discrepancy between
    the predicted states :math:`\hat{\mathbf{u}}_{t+1}` and the target states
    :math:`\mathbf{u}_{t+1}` over the sequence:

    .. math::

        \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{problem}} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=0}^{T-1}
        \mathcal{L} \left( \mathbf{u}_{t+1} - \hat{\mathbf{u}}_{t+1} \right),

    where :math:`\mathcal{L}` is the selected loss function, typically the mean
    squared error.

    The solver supports adaptive weighting of autoregressive steps through the
    ``eps`` parameter. During training, each autoregressive step can contribute
    differently to the total loss depending on its accumulated difficulty. Steps
    with larger running losses are assigned larger weights, so that the solver
    focuses more on parts of the rollout where prediction errors tend to
    accumulate. The parameter ``eps`` controls the strength of this effect:
    ``eps = 0`` disables adaptive weighting, while larger values increase the
    influence of high-loss steps on the final training objective.

            based on the new training dynamics. Default is ``True``.
