class PhysicsInformedEnsembleSolver(PhysicsInformedMixin, EnsembleSolver):
    r"""
    Ensemble-model solver for physics-informed learning problems.

    This solver approximates the solution of a differential problem using an
    ensemble of models. It is intended for problems whose conditions may include
    supervised data, equation residuals evaluated on input points, and equation
    residuals sampled from domains.

    Given an ensemble of models :math:`\{\mathcal{M}_j\}_{j=1}^{M}`, the
    predicted solution of each model is

    .. math::

        \hat{\mathbf{u}}^{(j)}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathcal{M}_j(\mathbf{x}),
        \qquad j = 1, \ldots, M.

    The solver minimizes the residuals of the differential operators defining
    the problem for each model in the ensemble. For a problem with governing
    equation operator :math:`\mathcal{A}` in the domain :math:`\Omega` and
    boundary operator :math:`\mathcal{B}` on the boundary
    :math:`\partial\Omega`, the objective can be written as

    .. math::

        \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{problem}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^{M}
        \left[ \frac{1}{N_{\Omega}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\Omega}} \mathcal{L}
        \left( \mathcal{A}[\hat{\mathbf{u}}^{(j)}](\mathbf{x}_i) \right)
        + \frac{1}{N_{\partial\Omega}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\partial\Omega}}
        \mathcal{L}
        \left( \mathcal{B}[\hat{\mathbf{u}}^{(j)}](\mathbf{x}_i) \right)
        \right],

    where :math:`\mathcal{L}` is the selected loss function, typically the
    mean squared error.
