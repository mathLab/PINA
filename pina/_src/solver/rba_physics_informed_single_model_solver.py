    r"""
    Residual-based attention solver for physics-informed learning problems.

    This solver approximates the solution of a differential problem using a
    single model equipped with residual-based attention weights. It can be used
    for both forward and inverse problems.

    Given a model :math:`\mathcal{M}`, the predicted solution is

    .. math::

        \hat{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathcal{M}(\mathbf{x}).

    The solver minimizes a weighted objective in which each residual
    contribution is scaled by an attention weight. For a problem with governing
    equation operator :math:`\mathcal{A}` in the domain :math:`\Omega` and
    boundary operator :math:`\mathcal{B}` on the boundary
    :math:`\partial\Omega`, the objective can be written as

    .. math::

        \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{problem}} =
        \frac{1}{N_{\Omega}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\Omega}}
        \lambda_{\Omega}^{i} \mathcal{L}
        \left( \mathcal{A}[\hat{\mathbf{u}}](\mathbf{x}_i) \right)
        + \frac{1}{N_{\partial\Omega}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\partial\Omega}}
        \lambda_{\partial\Omega}^{i} \mathcal{L}
        \left( \mathcal{B}[\hat{\mathbf{u}}](\mathbf{x}_i) \right),

    where :math:`\mathcal{L}` is the selected loss function, typically the
    mean squared error, and :math:`\lambda_{\Omega}^{i}` and
    :math:`\lambda_{\partial\Omega}^{i}` are the attention weights associated
    with the domain and boundary residuals, respectively.

    At each epoch, the attention weights are updated according to the magnitude
    of the corresponding residuals:

    .. math::

        \lambda_i^{k+1} = \gamma \lambda_i^k + \eta \frac{|r_i|}{\max_j |r_j|},

    where :math:`r_i` is the residual at point :math:`i`, :math:`\gamma` is the
    decay rate, and :math:`\eta` is the learning rate used for the attention
    weight update.
