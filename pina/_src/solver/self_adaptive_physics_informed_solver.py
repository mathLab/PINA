class SelfAdaptivePhysicsInformedSolver(
    _PhysicsInformedMixin, MultiModelSolver
):
    r"""
    Multi-model solver for self-adaptive physics-informed learning problems.

    This solver approximates the solution of a differential problem using a
    trainable model together with condition-wise self-adaptive weights. It is
    intended for problems whose conditions may include supervised data, equation
    residuals evaluated on input points, and equation residuals sampled from
    domains.

    Given a model :math:`\mathcal{M}`, the predicted solution is

    .. math::

        \hat{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathcal{M}(\mathbf{x}).

    For each condition, the solver introduces trainable pointwise weights. These
    weights are passed through a user-defined weight function :math:`m`,
    typically chosen to keep the effective weights bounded or positive. The
    resulting weighted objective encourages the model to focus on regions where
    the residual is larger.

    For a problem with governing equation operator :math:`\mathcal{A}` in the
    domain :math:`\Omega` and boundary operator :math:`\mathcal{B}` on the
    boundary :math:`\partial\Omega`, the objective can be written as

    .. math::

        \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{problem}} = \frac{1}{N_{\Omega}}
        \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\Omega}} m(\lambda_{\Omega}^{i}) \mathcal{L}
        \left( \mathcal{A}[\hat{\mathbf{u}}](\mathbf{x}_i) \right)
        + \frac{1}{N_{\partial\Omega}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\partial\Omega}}
        m(\lambda_{\partial\Omega}^{i})
        \mathcal{L} \left( \mathcal{B}[\hat{\mathbf{u}}](\mathbf{x}_i) \right),

    where :math:`\lambda_{\Omega}^{i}` and :math:`\lambda_{\partial\Omega}^{i}`
    are the self-adaptive weights associated with points in :math:`\Omega` and
    :math:`\partial\Omega`, respectively, and :math:`\mathcal{L}` is the
    selected loss function, typically the mean squared error.

    The model parameters and the self-adaptive weights are optimized through a
    min-max problem:

    .. math::

        \min_{\theta} \max_{\lambda} \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{problem}},

    where :math:`\theta` denotes the model parameters and :math:`\lambda`
    denotes the collection of self-adaptive weights.

    .. seealso::
