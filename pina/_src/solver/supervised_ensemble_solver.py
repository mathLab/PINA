class SupervisedEnsembleSolver(EnsembleSolver):
    r"""
    Ensemble-model solver for supervised learning problems.

    This solver approximates the mapping between input data and target data
    using an ensemble of models. It is intended for problems whose conditions
    are defined by input-target pairs and accepts only
    :class:`~pina._src.condition.input_target_condition.InputTargetCondition`.

    Given input samples :math:`\mathbf{s}_i`, target values
    :math:`\mathbf{u}_i`, and an ensemble of models
    :math:`\{\mathcal{M}_j\}_{j=1}^{M}`, the prediction of each model is

    .. math::

        \hat{\mathbf{u}}_{i}^{(j)} = \mathcal{M}_j(\mathbf{s}_i),
        \qquad j = 1, \ldots, M.

    The supervised training objective minimizes the discrepancy between the
    target values and the ensemble predictions:

    .. math::

        \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{problem}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^{M}
        \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathcal{L}
        \left( \mathbf{u}_i - \hat{\mathbf{u}}_{i}^{(j)} \right),

    where :math:`\mathcal{L}` is the selected loss function, typically the
    mean squared error.
