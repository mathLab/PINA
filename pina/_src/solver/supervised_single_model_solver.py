class SupervisedSingleModelSolver(SingleModelSolver):
    r"""
    Single-model solver for supervised learning problems.

    This solver is designed for problems defined by input-target pairs and uses
    a single model to approximate the mapping from input variables to target
    variables. It supports only
    :class:`~pina._src.condition.input_target_condition.InputTargetCondition`
    conditions.

    Given a model :math:`\mathcal{M}`, the solver minimizes the discrepancy
    between the target values :math:`\mathbf{u}_i` and the model predictions
    :math:`\mathcal{M}(\mathbf{s}_i)` evaluated at the input data
    :math:`\mathbf{s}_i`.

    The supervised loss minimized during training is

    .. math::

        \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{problem}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}
        \mathcal{L} \left( \mathbf{u}_i - \mathcal{M}(\mathbf{s}_i) \right),

    where :math:`\mathcal{L}` is the selected loss function, typically the mean
    squared error.
