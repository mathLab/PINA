    Base class for all weighting schemas, implementing common functionality.

    A weighting schema defines how scalar loss terms coming from different
    conditions are aggregated into a single scalar loss.

    All weighting schemas must inherit from this class and implement the methods
    defined in :class:`~pina.weighting.weighting_interface.WeightingInterface`.

    This class is not meant to be instantiated directly.

    :Example:

        >>> import torch
        >>> from pina.weighting import ScalarWeighting
        >>> weighting = ScalarWeighting(weights=1.0)
        >>> losses = {"loss_a": torch.tensor(0.5), "loss_b": torch.tensor(0.3)}
