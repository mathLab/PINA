"""
Mathematical equations and physical laws.

This module provides a framework for defining differential equations,
boundary conditions, and complex systems of equations. It includes
pre-defined physical models such as Poisson, Helmholtz, and Wave equations,
along with equations for common derivative-based constraints, such as
FixedValue, FixedGradient, FixedFlux, and FixedLaplacian.
