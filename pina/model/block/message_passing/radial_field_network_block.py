class RadialFieldNetworkBlock(MessagePassing):
    """
    Implementation of the Radial Field Network block.

    This block is used to perform message-passing between nodes and edges in a
    graph neural network, following the scheme proposed by Köhler et al. (2020).
    It serves as an inner block in a larger graph neural network architecture.

    The message between two nodes connected by an edge is computed by applying a
    linear transformation to the sender node features and the edge features,
    followed by a non-linear activation function. Messages are then aggregated
    using an aggregation scheme (e.g., sum, mean, min, max, or product).

    The update step is performed by a simple addition of the incoming messages
    to the node features.
