"""A public API for differential operators and automatic differentiation utilities.

This module provides standard vector calculus operators (gradient, divergence,
laplacian, advection) implemented using automatic differentiation. It includes
both high-level general operators and optimized 'fast' variants for improved
computational efficiency during training.
