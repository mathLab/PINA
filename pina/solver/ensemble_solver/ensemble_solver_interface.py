class DeepEnsembleSolverInterface(MultiSolverInterface):
    r"""
    A class for handling ensemble models in a multi-solver training framework.
    It allows for manual optimization, as well as the ability to train,
    validate, and test multiple models as part of an ensemble.
    The ensemble dimension can be customized to control how outputs are stacked.

    By default, it is compatible with problems defined by
    :class:`~pina.problem.abstract_problem.AbstractProblem`,
    and users can choose the problem type the solver is meant to address.

    An ensemble model is constructed by combining multiple models that solve
    the same type of problem. Mathematically, this creates an implicit
    distribution :math:`p(\mathbf{u} \mid \mathbf{s})` over the possible
    outputs :math:`\mathbf{u}`, given the original input :math:`\mathbf{s}`.
    The models :math:`\mathcal{M}_{i\in (1,\dots,r)}` in
    the ensemble work collaboratively to capture different
    aspects of the data or task, with each model contributing a distinct
    prediction :math:`\mathbf{y}_{i}=\mathcal{M}_i(\mathbf{u} \mid \mathbf{s})`.
    By aggregating these predictions, the ensemble
    model can achieve greater robustness and accuracy compared to individual
    models, leveraging the diversity of the models to reduce overfitting and
    improve generalization. Furthemore, statistical metrics can
    be computed, e.g. the ensemble mean and variance:

    .. math::
        \mathbf{\mu} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^r \mathbf{y}_{i}

    .. math::
        \mathbf{\sigma^2} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^r
        (\mathbf{y}_{i} - \mathbf{\mu})^2

    .. seealso::
