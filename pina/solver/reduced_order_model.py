class ReducedOrderModelSolver(SupervisedSolver):
    r"""
    Reduced Order Model solver class. This class implements the Reduced Order
    Model solver, using user specified ``reduction_network`` and
    ``interpolation_network`` to solve a specific ``problem``.

    The Reduced Order Model solver aims to find the solution
    :math:`\mathbf{u}:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^m` of a differential problem:

    .. math::

        \begin{cases}
        \mathcal{A}[\mathbf{u}(\mu)](\mathbf{x})=0\quad,\mathbf{x}\in\Omega\\
        \mathcal{B}[\mathbf{u}(\mu)](\mathbf{x})=0\quad,
        \mathbf{x}\in\partial\Omega
        \end{cases}

    This is done by means of two neural networks: the ``reduction_network``,
    which defines an encoder :math:`\mathcal{E}_{\rm{net}}`, and a decoder
    :math:`\mathcal{D}_{\rm{net}}`; and the ``interpolation_network``
    :math:`\mathcal{I}_{\rm{net}}`. The input is assumed to be discretised in
    the spatial dimensions.

    The following loss function is minimized during training:

    .. math::
        \mathcal{L}_{\rm{problem}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N
        \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{E}_{\rm{net}}[\mathbf{u}(\mu_i)] -
        \mathcal{I}_{\rm{net}}[\mu_i]) + 
        \mathcal{L}(
            \mathcal{D}_{\rm{net}}[\mathcal{E}_{\rm{net}}[\mathbf{u}(\mu_i)]] -
            \mathbf{u}(\mu_i))

    where :math:`\mathcal{L}` is a specific loss function, typically the MSE:

    .. math::
        \mathcal{L}(v) = \| v \|^2_2.

    .. note::
        The specified ``reduction_network`` must contain two methods, namely
        ``encode`` for input encoding, and ``decode`` for decoding the former
        result. The ``interpolation_network`` network ``forward`` output
        represents the interpolation of the latent space obtained with
        ``reduction_network.encode``.

    .. note::
        This solver uses the end-to-end training strategy, i.e. the
        ``reduction_network`` and ``interpolation_network`` are trained
        simultaneously. For reference on this trainig strategy look at the
        following:

    .. warning::
        This solver works only for data-driven model. Hence in the ``problem``
        definition the codition must only contain ``input``
        (e.g. coefficient parameters, time parameters), and ``target``.
