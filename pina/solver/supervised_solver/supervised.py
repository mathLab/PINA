class SupervisedSolver(SupervisedSolverInterface, SingleSolverInterface):
    r"""
    Supervised Solver solver class. This class implements a Supervised Solver,
    using a user specified ``model`` to solve a specific ``problem``.

    The  Supervised Solver class aims to find a map between the input
    :math:`\mathbf{s}:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^m` and the output
    :math:`\mathbf{u}:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^m`.

    Given a model :math:`\mathcal{M}`, the following loss function is
    minimized during training:

    .. math::
        \mathcal{L}_{\rm{problem}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N
        \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{u}_i - \mathcal{M}(\mathbf{s}_i)),

    where :math:`\mathcal{L}` is a specific loss function, typically the MSE:

    .. math::
        \mathcal{L}(v) = \| v \|^2_2.

    In this context, :math:`\mathbf{u}_i` and :math:`\mathbf{s}_i` indicates
    the will to approximate multiple (discretised) functions given multiple
    (discretised) input functions.
