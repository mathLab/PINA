    "After we define the `Problem` class, we need to write different class methods, where each method is a function returning a residual. These functions are the ones minimized during PINN optimization, given the initial conditions. For example, in the domain $[0,1]$, the ODE equation (`ode_equation`) must be satisfied. We represent this by returning the difference between subtracting the variable `u` from its gradient (the residual), which we hope to minimize to 0. This is done for all conditions. Notice that we do not pass directly a `python` function, but an `Equation` object, which is initialized with the `python` function. This is done so that all the computations and internal checks are done inside **PINA**.\n",
