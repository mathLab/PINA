    "In **PINA**, defining a problem is done by creating a Python `class` that inherits from one or more problem classes, such as `SpatialProblem`, `TimeDependentProblem`, or `ParametricProblem`, depending on the nature of the problem. We refer to the `model` as the object that solves the problem, e.g., a **Neural Network**.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. ***Data-Driven Problems***: The model is trained using data, such as in classification networks or autoencoders.\n",
    "2. ***Physics-Driven Problems***: The model is trained using physical laws representing the problem, such as in **PINNs**.\n",
    "Let's start by building the first type, the data driven type. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data driven modelling\n",
    "In data-driven modelling, we always have an **input** and a **target**. The model's objective is to reconstruct the target from the input. Examples include:\n",
    "- Image reconstruction (perturbed image as input, clear image as target)\n",
    "- Classification (e.g., input: molecule, target: chemical properties)\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a data-driven problem in **PINA**, you can inherit from the `AbstractProblem` class. Below is an example of a regression problem where the input is a scalar value `x` and the target is a scalar value `y`.\n",

If you prefer to use regular tensors, you can simply set these to ``None``.\n",

Once the condition is applied, the full problem is outlined below:"

    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing the introductory tutorial of **PINA** problems! There are several directions you can explore next:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Custom Problems**: Try building your own problems using the PINA framework, experiment with different PDEs, initial/boundary conditions, and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explore the Problem Zoo**: Dive into the [`problem.zoo` module](https://mathlab.github.io/PINA/_rst/_code.html#problems-zoo) to find a variety of predefined problem setups and use them as a starting point or inspiration for your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **...and many more!**: The possibilities are vast! Consider experimenting with different solver strategies, model architectures, or even implementing your own physical constraints.\n",
    "\n",
