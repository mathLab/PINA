    "PINNs are deep learning models that integrate the laws of physics directly into the training process. By incorporating **differential equations** and **boundary conditions** into the loss function, PINNs allow the modeling of complex physical systems while ensuring the predictions remain consistent with scientific laws.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we will solve a **2D Poisson problem** with **Dirichlet boundary conditions** on an **hourglass-shaped domain** using a simple PINN [4]. You can explore other PINN variants, e.g. [5] or [6] in PINA by visiting the [PINA solvers documentation](https://mathlab.github.io/PINA/_rst/_code.html#solvers). We aim to solve the following 2D Poisson problem:\n",

    "The `Equation` class can be very useful for creating modular problem classes. If you're interested, check out [this tutorial](https://mathlab.github.io/PINA/_rst/tutorial12/tutorial.html) for more details.
