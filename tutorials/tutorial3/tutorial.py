# 
# In this tutorial we present how to solve the wave equation using hard constraint PINNs. For doing so we will build a costum `torch` model and pass it to the `PINN` solver.

# First of all, some useful imports.

# ## The problem definition 

# The problem is written in the following form:
# 
# \begin{equation}
# \begin{cases}
# \Delta u(x,y,t) = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} u(x,y,t) \quad \text{in } D, \\\\
# u(x, y, t=0) = \sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y), \\\\
# u(x, y, t) = 0 \quad \text{on } \Gamma_1 \cup \Gamma_2 \cup \Gamma_3 \cup \Gamma_4,
# \end{cases}
# \end{equation}
# 
# where $D$ is a squared domain $[0,1]^2$, and $\Gamma_i$, with $i=1,...,4$, are the boundaries of the square, and the velocity in the standard wave equation is fixed to one.

# Now, the wave problem is written in PINA code as a class, inheriting from `SpatialProblem` and `TimeDependentProblem` since we deal with spatial, and time dependent variables. The equations are written as `conditions` that should be satisfied in the corresponding domains. `truth_solution` is the exact solution which will be compared with the predicted one.

# ## Hard Constraint Model

# After the problem, a **torch** model is needed to solve the PINN. Usually, many models are already implemented in **PINA**, but the user has the possibility to build his/her own model in `torch`. The hard constraint we impose is on the boundary of the spatial domain. Specifically, our solution is written as:
# 
# $$ u_{\rm{pinn}} = xy(1-x)(1-y)\cdot NN(x, y, t), $$
# 
# where $NN$ is the neural net output. This neural network takes as input the coordinates (in this case $x$, $y$ and $t$) and provides the unknown field $u$. By construction, it is zero on the boundaries. The residuals of the equations are evaluated at several sampling points (which the user can manipulate using the method `discretise_domain`) and the loss minimized by the neural network is the sum of the residuals.

    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()

        self.layers = torch.nn.Sequential(
            torch.nn.Linear(input_dim, 40),
            torch.nn.ReLU(),
            torch.nn.Linear(40, 40),

            torch.nn.Linear(40, output_dim),

    def forward(self, x):
        hard = (
            x.extract(["x"])
            * (1 - x.extract(["x"]))
            * x.extract(["y"])
            * (1 - x.extract(["y"]))
        )

# ## Train and Inference

# In this tutorial, the neural network is trained for 1000 epochs with a learning rate of 0.001 (default in `PINN`). As always, we will log using `Tensorboard`.

# Let's now plot the logging to see how the losses vary during training. For this, we will use `TensorBoard`.

# Notice that the loss on the boundaries of the spatial domain is exactly zero, as expected! After the training is completed one can now plot some results using the `matplotlib`. We plot the predicted output on the left side, the true solution at the center and the difference on the right side using the `plot_solution` function.

# The results are not so great, and we can clearly see that as time progresses the solution gets worse.... Can we do better?
# 
# A valid option is to impose the initial condition as hard constraint as well. Specifically, our solution is written as:
# 
# $$ u_{\rm{pinn}} = xy(1-x)(1-y)\cdot NN(x, y, t)\cdot t + \cos(\sqrt{2}\pi t)\sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y), $$

# Now let's train with the same configuration as the previous test

# In[9]:


# define model
model = HardMLPtime(len(problem.input_variables), len(problem.output_variables))

# crete the solver
pinn = PINN(problem=problem, model=model)

# create trainer and train

    train_size=1.0,
    val_size=0.0,
    test_size=0.0,
    logger=TensorBoardLogger("tutorial_logs")
)
trainer.train()


# We can clearly see that the loss is way lower now. Let's plot the results

# In[10]:


plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plot_solution(solver=pinn, time=0)

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plot_solution(solver=pinn, time=0.5)

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plot_solution(solver=pinn, time=1)


# We can see now that the results are way better! This is due to the fact that previously the network was  not learning correctly the initial conditon, leading to a poor solution when time evolved. By imposing the initial condition the network is able to correctly solve the problem. We can also see how the two losses decreased using Tensorboard.

print("To visualize the loss you can run tensorboard --logdir 'tutorial_logs' on your terminal")


# ## What's next?
# 
# Congratulations on completing the two dimensional Wave tutorial of **PINA**! There are multiple directions you can go now:
# 
# 1. Train the network for longer or with different layer sizes and assert the finaly accuracy
# 
# 2. Propose new types of hard constraints in time, e.g. $$ u_{\rm{pinn}} = xy(1-x)(1-y)\cdot NN(x, y, t)(1-\exp(-t)) + \cos(\sqrt{2}\pi t)sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y), $$
# 
# 3. Exploit extrafeature training for model 1 and 2
# 
# 4. Many more...
