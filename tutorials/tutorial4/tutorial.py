The implementation of the filter follows the original work [*A Continuous Convolutional Trainable Filter for Modelling Unstructured Data*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13416).

#

# ## Continuous Filter Background
#
# As reported by the authors in the original paper, in contrast to discrete convolution, **continuous convolution** is mathematically defined as:
#
# $$
#     \mathcal{I}_{\rm{out}}(\mathbf{x}) = \int_{\mathcal{X}}  \mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{\tau}) \cdot \mathcal{K}(\mathbf{\tau}) d\mathbf{\tau},
# $$
#
# where:
# - $\mathcal{K} : \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the **continuous filter** function,
# - $\mathcal{I} : \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the input function.
#
# The **continuous filter function** is approximated using a **FeedForward Neural Network**, which is **trainable** during the training phase. The way in which the integral is approximated can vary. In the **PINA** framework, we approximate it using a simple sum, as suggested by the authors. Thus, given the points $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ mapped onto the filter domain $\mathcal{X}$, we approximate the equation as:
#
# $$
#     \mathcal{I}_{\rm{out}}(\mathbf{\tilde{x}}_i) = \sum_{{\mathbf{x}_i}\in\mathcal{X}}  \mathcal{I}(\mathbf{x}_i + \mathbf{\tau}) \cdot \mathcal{K}(\mathbf{x}_i),
# $$
#
# where $\mathbf{\tau} \in \mathcal{S}$, with $\mathcal{S}$ being the set of available strides, represents the current stride position of the filter. The $\mathbf{\tilde{x}}_i$ points are obtained by taking the **centroid** of the filter position mapped onto the domain $\Omega$.
#
# ### Working with the Continuous Filter
#
# From the above definition, what is needed is:
# 1. A **domain** and a **function** defined on that domain (the input),
# 2. A **stride**, corresponding to the positions where the filter needs to be applied (this is the `stride` variable in `ContinuousConv`),
# 3. The **filter's rectangular domain**, which corresponds to the `filter_dim` variable in `ContinuousConv`.
#
# ### Input Function
#
# The input function for the continuous filter is defined as a tensor of shape:
#
# $$[B \times N_{\text{in}} \times N \times D]$$
#
# where:
# - $B$ is the **batch size**,
# - $N_{\text{in}}$ is the number of input fields,
# - $N$ is the number of points in the mesh,
# - $D$ is the dimension of the problem.
#
# In particular:
# - $D$ represents the **number of spatial variables** + 1. The last column must contain the field value. For example, for 2D problems, $D=3$ and the tensor will look like `[first coordinate, second coordinate, field value]`.
# - $N_{\text{in}}$ represents the number of vectorial functions presented. For example, a vectorial function $f = [f_1, f_2]$ will have $N_{\text{in}}=2$.
#
# #### Example: Input Function for a Vectorial Field
#
# Letâ€™s see an example to clarify the idea. Suppose we wish to create the function:
#
# $$
# f(x, y) = [\sin(\pi x) \sin(\pi y), -\sin(\pi x) \sin(\pi y)] \quad (x,y)\in[0,1]\times[0,1]
# $$
#
# We can do this with a **batch size** equal to 1. This function consists of two components (vectorial field), so $N_{\text{in}}=2$. For each $(x,y)$ pair in the domain $[0,1] \times [0,1]$, we will compute the corresponding field values:
#
# 1. $\sin(\pi x) \sin(\pi y)$
# 2. $-\sin(\pi x) \sin(\pi y)$

# In[2]:


# batch size fixed to 1
batch_size = 1

# points in the mesh fixed to 200
N = 200

# vectorial 2 dimensional function, number_input_fields=2
number_input_fields = 2

# 2 dimensional spatial variables, D = 2 + 1 = 3
D = 3

# create the function f domain as random 2d points in [0, 1]
domain = torch.rand(size=(batch_size, number_input_fields, N, D - 1))
print(f"Domain has shape: {domain.shape}")

# create the functions
pi = torch.acos(torch.tensor([-1.0]))  # pi value
f1 = torch.sin(pi * domain[:, 0, :, 0]) * torch.sin(pi * domain[:, 0, :, 1])
f2 = -torch.sin(pi * domain[:, 1, :, 0]) * torch.sin(pi * domain[:, 1, :, 1])

# stacking the input domain and field values
data = torch.empty(size=(batch_size, number_input_fields, N, D))
data[..., :-1] = domain  # copy the domain
data[:, 0, :, -1] = f1  # copy first field value
data[:, 1, :, -1] = f1  # copy second field value
print(f"Filter input data has shape: {data.shape}")


# ### Stride
#
# The **stride** is passed as a dictionary `stride` that dictates where the filter should move. Here's an example for the domain $[0,1] \times [0,5]$:
#
# ```python
# # stride definition
# stride = {"domain": [1, 5],
#           "start": [0, 0],
#           "jump": [0.1, 0.3],
#           "direction": [1, 1],
#           }
# ```
# This tells the filter:
# 1. `domain`: The domain over which the filter operates. In this case, the filter works over the $[0,1] \times [0,5]$ domain. The minimum value is always zero, and the maximum value is specified by the user.
# 2. `start`: The starting position of the filter's centroid. In this example, the filter starts at the position $(0, 0)$.
# 3. `jump`: The steps or jumps of the filterâ€™s centroid to the next position. In this example, the filter moves by $(0.1, 0.3)$ along the x and y axes respectively.
# 4. `direction`: The directions of the jumps for each coordinate. A value of 1 indicates the filter moves right, 0 means no movement, and -1 indicates the filter moves left with respect to its current position.
#
# ### Filter definition
#
# Now that we have defined the stride, we can move on to construct the continuous filter.
# Letâ€™s assume we want the output to contain only one field, and we will set the filter dimension to be $[0.1, 0.1]$.

# In[3]:


# filter dim
filter_dim = [0.1, 0.1]

# stride
stride = {
    "domain": [1, 1],
    "start": [0, 0],
    "jump": [0.08, 0.08],
    "direction": [1, 1],
}

# creating the filter
cConv = ContinuousConvBlock(
    input_numb_field=number_input_fields,
    output_numb_field=1,
    filter_dim=filter_dim,
    stride=stride,
)


# That's it! In just one line of code, we have successfully created the continuous convolutional filter. By default, the `pina.model.FeedForward` neural network is initialized, which can be further customized according to your needs.
#
# Additionally, if the mesh does not change during training, we can set the `optimize` flag to `True` to leverage optimizations for efficiently finding the points to convolve. This feature helps in improving the performance by reducing redundant calculations when the mesh remains constant.

# In[4]:


# creating the filter + optimization
cConv = ContinuousConvBlock(
    input_numb_field=number_input_fields,
    output_numb_field=1,
    filter_dim=filter_dim,
    stride=stride,
    optimize=True,
)


# Let's try to do a forward pass:

# In[5]:


print(f"Filter input data has shape: {data.shape}")

# input to the filter
output = cConv(data)

print(f"Filter output data has shape: {output.shape}")


# If you don't want to use the default `FeedForward` neural network, you can pass a custom PyTorch model by specifying it in the `model` keyword. Here's an example of how to do it:

# In[6]:


class SimpleKernel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.model = torch.nn.Sequential(
            torch.nn.Linear(2, 20),
            torch.nn.ReLU(),
            torch.nn.Linear(20, 20),
            torch.nn.ReLU(),
            torch.nn.Linear(20, 1),
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.model(x)


cConv = ContinuousConvBlock(
    input_numb_field=number_input_fields,
    output_numb_field=1,
    filter_dim=filter_dim,
    stride=stride,
    optimize=True,
    model=SimpleKernel,
)


# Notice that we pass the **class** of the model and not an already built object! This is important because the `ContinuousConv` filter will automatically instantiate the model class when needed during training.
#
# ## Building a MNIST Classifier
#
# Let's see how we can build a MNIST classifier using a continuous convolutional filter. We will use the MNIST dataset from PyTorch. In order to keep small training times we use only 6000 samples for training and 1000 samples for testing.

# In[7]:


numb_training = 6000  # get just 6000 images for training
numb_testing = 1000  # get just 1000 images for training
seed = 111  # for reproducibility
batch_size = 8  # setting batch size

# setting the seed
torch.manual_seed(seed)

# downloading the dataset
train_data = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(
    "./tutorial_logs/",
    download=True,
    train=False,
    transform=torchvision.transforms.Compose(
        [
            torchvision.transforms.ToTensor(),
            torchvision.transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,)),
        ]
    ),
)


# Now, let's proceed to build a simple classifier for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of vectors with the shape `[batch, 1, 28, 28]`, but we can treat them as field functions where each pixel at coordinates $i,j$ corresponds to a point in a $[0, 27] \times [0, 27]$ domain. The pixel values represent the field values.
#
# To use the continuous convolutional filter, we need to transform the regular tensor into a format compatible with the filter. Here's a function that will help with this transformation:

# In[8]:


def transform_input(x):
    batch_size = x.shape[0]
    dim_grid = tuple(x.shape[:-3:-1])

    # creating the n dimensional mesh grid for a single channel image
    values_mesh = [torch.arange(0, dim).float() for dim in dim_grid]
    mesh = torch.meshgrid(values_mesh)
    coordinates_mesh = [m.reshape(-1, 1).to(x.device) for m in mesh]
    coordinates = (
        torch.cat(coordinates_mesh, dim=1)
        .unsqueeze(0)
        .repeat((batch_size, 1, 1))
        .unsqueeze(1)
    )

    return torch.cat((coordinates, x.flatten(2).unsqueeze(-1)), dim=-1)


# We can now build a simple classifier! We will use just one convolutional filter followed by a feedforward neural network

# In[9]:


# setting the seed
torch.manual_seed(seed)


class ContinuousClassifier(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        # number of classes for classification
        numb_class = 10

        # convolutional block
        self.convolution = ContinuousConvBlock(
            input_numb_field=1,
            output_numb_field=4,
            stride={
                "domain": [27, 27],
                "start": [0, 0],
                "jumps": [4, 4],
                "direction": [1, 1.0],
            },
            filter_dim=[4, 4],
            optimize=True,
        )
        # feedforward net
        self.nn = FeedForward(
            input_dimensions=196,
            output_dimensions=numb_class,
            layers=[120, 64],
            func=torch.nn.ReLU,
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        # transform input + convolution
        x = transform_input(x)
        x = self.convolution(x)
        # feed forward classification
        return self.nn(x[..., -1].flatten(1))


# We now aim to solve a classification problem. For this we will use the `SupervisedSolver` and the `SupervisedProblem`. The input of the supervised problems are the images, while the output the corresponding class. We will train with `CrossEntropyLoss`.

# In[10]:


# setting the problem
problem = SupervisedProblem(
    input_=train_data.train_data.unsqueeze(1),  # adding channel dimension
    output_=train_data.train_labels,
)

# setting the solver

    problem=problem,
    model=ContinuousClassifier(),
    loss=torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss(),
    use_lt=False,
)

# setting the trainer

    solver=solver,
    max_epochs=1,
    accelerator="cpu",
    enable_model_summary=False,
    train_size=0.7,
    val_size=0.1,
    test_size=0.2,
    batch_size=64,
)
trainer.train()


# Let's see the performance on the test set!

# In[11]:


correct = 0
total = 0
trainer.data_module.setup("test")
with torch.no_grad():
    for data in trainer.data_module.test_dataloader():
        test_data = data["data"]
        images, labels = test_data["input"], test_data["target"]
        # calculate outputs by running images through the network
        outputs = solver(images)
        # the class with the highest energy is what we choose as prediction
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

print(f"Accuracy of the network on the test images: {(correct / total):.3%}")


# As we can see we have very good performance for having trained only for 1 epoch! Nevertheless, we are still using structured data... Let's see how we can build an autoencoder for unstructured data now.
#
# ## Building a Continuous Convolutional Autoencoder
#
# As a toy problem, we will now build an autoencoder for the function \( f(x, y) = \sin(\pi x) \sin(\pi y) \) on the unit circle domain centered at \( (0.5, 0.5) \). We will also explore the ability to up-sample the results (once trained) without needing to retrain the model. To begin, we'll generate the input data for the function. First, we will use a mesh of 100 points and visualize the input function. Hereâ€™s how to proceed:

# In[12]:


# create inputs
def circle_grid(N=100):
    """Generate points withing a unit 2D circle centered in (0.5, 0.5)

    :param N: number of points
    :type N: float
    :return: [x, y] array of points
    :rtype: torch.tensor
    """

    PI = torch.acos(torch.zeros(1)).item() * 2
    R = 0.5
    centerX = 0.5
    centerY = 0.5

    r = R * torch.sqrt(torch.rand(N))
    theta = torch.rand(N) * 2 * PI

    x = centerX + r * torch.cos(theta)
    y = centerY + r * torch.sin(theta)

    return torch.stack([x, y]).T


# create the grid
grid = circle_grid(500)

# create input
input_data = torch.empty(size=(1, 1, grid.shape[0], 3))
input_data[0, 0, :, :-1] = grid
input_data[0, 0, :, -1] = torch.sin(pi * grid[:, 0]) * torch.sin(
    pi * grid[:, 1]
)

# visualize data
plt.title("Training sample with 500 points")
plt.scatter(grid[:, 0], grid[:, 1], c=input_data[0, 0, :, -1])
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()


# Now, let's create a simple autoencoder using the continuous convolutional filter. Since the data is inherently unstructured, a standard convolutional filter may not be effective without some form of projection or interpolation. We'll begin by building an `Encoder` and `Decoder` class, and then combine them into a unified `Autoencoder` class.

# In[13]:


class Encoder(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_dimension):
        super().__init__()

        # convolutional block

# Great! In the `Decoder` class, during the `forward` pass, we used the `.transpose()` method of the `ContinuousConvolution` class. This method takes the `weights` for upsampling and the `grid` on which to perform the upsampling. Now, let's go ahead and build the autoencoder! We'll define the hidden dimension with the `hidden_dimension` variable, and apply the sigmoid function on the output since the field values are constrained within the range $[0, 1]$.

# In[14]:


class Autoencoder(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_dimension=10):

        # decoder
        out = self.decoder(weights, grid)
        return out


# Now, let's proceed with training the autoencoder by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) loss and optimizing using the Adam optimizer. We'll use the `SupervisedSolver` for the training, and the problem will be defined as a simple problem inherited from `AbstractProblem`.

# In[15]:


# define the problem

# visualize data
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(8, 3))

    )

# The $l_2$ error is approximately $4\%$, which is quite low considering that we only use **one** convolutional layer and a simple feedforward network to reduce the dimension. Now, let's explore some of the unique features of the filter.
#
# ### Upsampling with the Filter
#
# Suppose we have a hidden representation and we want to upsample it on a different grid with more points. Let's see how we can achieve that:

# In[18]:

input_data2[0, 0, :, -1] = torch.sin(pi * grid2[:, 0]) * torch.sin(
    pi * grid2[:, 1]
)

# get the hidden representation from original input
latent = solver.model.encoder(input_data)

# upsample on the second input_data2
output = solver.model.decoder(latent, input_data2).detach()

# show the picture
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(8, 3))

pic2 = axes[1].scatter(grid2[:, 0], grid2[:, 1], c=output[0, 0, :, -1])
axes[1].set_title("Up-sampling")

# ## What's Next?
#
# Congratulations on completing the tutorial on using the Continuous Convolutional Filter in **PINA**! Now that you have the basics, there are several exciting directions you can explore:
#
# 1. **Train using Physics-Informed strategies**: Leverage physics-based knowledge to improve model performance for solving real-world problems.
#
# 2. **Use the filter to build an unstructured convolutional autoencoder**: Explore reduced-order modeling by implementing unstructured convolutional autoencoders.
#
# 3. **Experiment with upsampling at different resolutions**: Try encoding or upsampling on different grids to see how the model generalizes across multiple resolutions.
#
# 4. **...and many more!**: There are endless possibilities, from improving model architecture to testing with more complex datasets.
