# # Tutorial: Reduced order model (PODNN) for parametric problems

# The tutorial aims to show how to employ the **PINA** library in order to apply a reduced order modeling technique [1]. Such methodologies have several similarities with machine learning approaches, since the main goal consists of predicting the solution of differential equations (typically parametric PDEs) in a real-time fashion.
# 
# In particular we are going to use the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition with Neural Network (PODNN) [2], which basically perform a dimensional reduction using the POD approach, approximating the parametric solution manifold (at the reduced space) using a NN. In this example, we use a simple multilayer perceptron, but the plenty of different archiutectures can be plugged as well.

# We exploit the [Smithers](www.github.com/mathLab/Smithers) library to collect the parametric snapshots. In particular, we use the `NavierStokesDataset` class that contains a set of parametric solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in a 2D L-shape domain. The parameter is the inflow velocity.
# The dataset is composed by 500 snapshots of the velocity (along $x$, $y$, and the magnitude) and pressure fields, and the corresponding parameter values.
# 
# To visually check the snapshots, let's plot also the data points and the reference solution: this is the expected output of the neural network.

for ax, p, u in zip(axs, dataset.params[:4], dataset.snapshots['mag(v)'][:4]):
    ax.tricontourf(dataset.triang, u, levels=16)
    ax.set_title(f'$\mu$ = {p[0]:.2f}')


# The *snapshots* - aka the numerical solutions computed for several parameters - and the corresponding parameters are the only data we need to train the model, in order to predict for any new test parameter the solution.
# To properly validate the accuracy, we initially split the 500 snapshots into the training dataset (90% of the original data) and the testing one (the reamining 10%). It must be said that, to plug the snapshots into **PINA**, we have to cast them to `LabelTensor` objects.

# In[31]:


u = torch.tensor(dataset.snapshots['mag(v)']).float()
p = torch.tensor(dataset.params).float()

p = LabelTensor(p, labels=['mu'])
u = LabelTensor(u, labels=[f's{i}' for i in range(u.shape[1])])

ratio_train_test = 0.9
n = u.shape
n_train = int(u.shape[0] * ratio_train_test)
n_test = u - n_train
u_train, u_test = u[:n_train], u[n_train:]
p_train, p_test = p[:n_train], p[n_train:]


# It is now time to define the problem! We inherit from `ParametricProblem` (since the space invariant typically of this methodology), just defining a simple *input-output* condition.

# In[32]:


class SnapshotProblem(ParametricProblem):
    output_variables = [f's{i}' for i in range(u.shape[1])]
    parameter_domain = CartesianDomain({'mu': [0, 100]})

    conditions = {
        'io': Condition(input_points=p, output_points=u)
    }


# Then, we define the model we want to use: basically we have a MLP architecture that takes in input the parameter and return the *modal coefficients*, so the reduced dimension representation (the coordinates in the POD space). Such latent variable is the projected to the original space using the POD modes, which are computed and stored in the `PODBlock` object.
