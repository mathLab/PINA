# 
# This tutorial demonstrates how to solve a one-dimensional Helmholtz equation with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).  
# We will use standard PINN training, augmented with a periodic input expansion as introduced in [*An Expert’s Guide to Training Physics-Informed Neural Networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08468).

# ## Problem Definition
# 
# The one-dimensional Helmholtz problem is mathematically expressed as:
# 
# $$
# \begin{cases}
# \frac{d^2}{dx^2}u(x) - \lambda u(x) - f(x) &= 0 \quad \text{for } x \in (0, 2) \\
# u^{(m)}(x = 0) - u^{(m)}(x = 2) &= 0 \quad \text{for } m \in \{0, 1, \dots\}
# \end{cases}
# $$
# 
# In this case, we seek a solution that is $C^{\infty}$ (infinitely differentiable) and periodic with period 2, over the infinite domain $x \in (-\infty, \infty)$. 
# 
# A classical PINN approach would require enforcing periodic boundary conditions (PBC) for all derivatives—an infinite set of constraints—which is clearly infeasible.
# 
# To address this, we adopt a strategy known as *coordinate augmentation*. In this approach, we apply a coordinate transformation $v(x)$ such that the transformed inputs naturally satisfy the periodicity condition:
# 
# $$
# u^{(m)}(x = 0) - u^{(m)}(x = 2) = 0 \quad \text{for } m \in \{0, 1, \dots\}
# $$
# 
# For demonstration purposes, we choose the specific parameters:
# 
# - $\lambda = -10\pi^2$
# - $f(x) = -6\pi^2 \sin(3\pi x) \cos(\pi x)$
# 
# These yield an analytical solution:
# 
# $$
# u(x) = \sin(\pi x) \cos(3\pi x)
# $$

# As usual, the Helmholtz problem is implemented in **PINA** as a class. The governing equations are defined as `conditions`, which must be satisfied within their respective domains. The `solution` represents the exact analytical solution, which will be used to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted solution.
# 
# For selecting collocation points, we use Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), a common strategy for efficient space-filling in high-dimensional domains 
# 
# ## Solving the Problem with a Periodic Network
# 
# Any $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ periodic function  $u : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with period $L \in \mathbb{N}$  
# can be constructed by composing an arbitrary smooth function  $f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with a smooth, periodic mapping$v : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ of the same period $L$. That is,
# 
# $$
# u(x) = f(v(x)).
# $$
# 
# This formulation is general and can be extended to arbitrary dimensions.  
# For more details, see [*A Method for Representing Periodic Functions and Enforcing Exactly Periodic Boundary Conditions with Deep Neural Networks*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07442).
# 
# In our specific case, we define the periodic embedding as:
# 
# $$
# v(x) = \left[1, \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{L} x\right), \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{L} x\right)\right],
# $$
# 
# which constitutes the coordinate augmentation. The function $f(\cdot)$ is approximated by a neural network $NN_{\theta}(\cdot)$, resulting in the approximate PINN solution:
# 
# $$
# u(x) \approx u_{\theta}(x) = NN_{\theta}(v(x)).
# $$
# 
# In **PINA**, this is implemented using the `PeriodicBoundaryEmbedding` layer for $v(x)$,  
# paired with any `pina.model` to define the neural network $NN_{\theta}$.  
# 
# Let’s see how this is put into practice!
# 
# 

# In[18]:


# we encapsulate all modules in a torch.nn.Sequential container
model = torch.nn.Sequential(
    PeriodicBoundaryEmbedding(input_dimension=1, periods=2),
    FeedForward(
        input_dimensions=3,  # output of PeriodicBoundaryEmbedding = 3 * input_dimension
        output_dimensions=1,
        layers=[64, 64],
    ),
)


# As simple as that!
# 
# In higher dimensions, you can specify different periods for each coordinate using a dictionary.  
# For example, `periods = {'x': 2, 'y': 3, ...}` indicates a periodicity of 2 in the $x$ direction,  
# 3 in the $y$ direction, and so on.
# 
# We will now solve the problem using the usual `PINN` and `Trainer` classes. After training, we'll examine the losses using the `MetricTracker` callback from `pina.callback`.

# In[ ]:


solver = PINN(problem=problem, model=model)
trainer = Trainer(
    solver,
    max_epochs=2000,
    accelerator="cpu",
    enable_model_summary=False,
    callbacks=[MetricTracker()],
)
trainer.train()


# In[20]:


# plot loss
trainer_metrics = trainer.callbacks[0].metrics
plt.plot(
    range(len(trainer_metrics["train_loss"])), trainer_metrics["train_loss"]
)
# plotting
plt.xlabel("epoch")
plt.ylabel("loss")
plt.yscale("log")


# We are going to plot the solution now!

# In[21]:


pts = solver.problem.spatial_domain.sample(256, "grid", variables="x")
predicted_output = solver(pts).extract("u").tensor.detach()
true_output = solver.problem.solution(pts)
plt.plot(pts.extract(["x"]), predicted_output, label="Neural Network solution")
plt.plot(pts.extract(["x"]), true_output, label="True solution")
plt.legend()


# Great, they overlap perfectly! This seems a good result, considering the simple neural network used to some this (complex) problem. We will now test the neural network on the domain $[-4, 4]$ without retraining. In principle the periodicity should be present since the $v$ function ensures the periodicity in $(-\infty, \infty)$.

# It's clear that the network successfully captures the periodicity of the solution, with the error also exhibiting a periodic pattern. Naturally, training for a longer duration or using a more expressive neural network could further improve the results.
# ## What's next?
# 
# Congratulations on completing the one-dimensional Helmholtz tutorial with **PINA**! Here are a few directions you can explore next:
# 
# 1. **Train longer or with different architectures**: Experiment with extended training or modify the network's depth and width to evaluate improvements in accuracy.
# 
# 2. **Apply `PeriodicBoundaryEmbedding` to time-dependent problems**: Explore more complex scenarios such as spatiotemporal PDEs (see the official documentation for examples).
# 
# 3. **Try extra feature training**: Integrate additional physical or domain-specific features to guide the learning process more effectively.
# 
# 4. **...and many more!**: Extend to higher dimensions, test on other PDEs, or even develop custom embeddings tailored to your problem.
